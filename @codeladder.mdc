## üéØ Key Differentiators

1. **Structured Mastery-Based Learning**: A clear path from beginner to advanced, unlike the topic-based-only approach of competitors.
2. **Integrated Spaced Repetition**: A core, built-in feature using a scientific algorithm to ensure long-term retention of concepts, a feature absent in platforms like LeetCode.
3. **Advanced IDE Experience**: Utilizes Monaco Editor, the engine powering VS Code, for a superior coding environment with advanced features not found in standard text areas on other platforms.
4. **Holistic Learning Approach**: Combines theoretical content (INFO problems), practical coding challenges, and quizzes for a well-rounded understanding.
5. **Real Code Execution**: Practical programming practice with immediate feedback across 10+ languages powered by Judge0.
6. **Modern & Performant Tech Stack**: Built with current best practices and technologies for a fast, responsive, and scalable user experience.
